# Vagrant SSH

This is a work-in-progress project to learn to use Vagrant. 

The goal is to create 3 machines and that 4 users log in automatically on a specific time interval to these machines. 

Login information should be printed out with the help of a script, so the default user "vagrant" can see when each user has logged (first login, last login, time between the last two logins and average time between all logins).
