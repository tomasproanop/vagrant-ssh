# Vagrant SSH

This is a work-in-progress project to learn to use Vagrant and about shell scripting. 

The goal is to create 3 machines and that 4 users log in automatically in a certain time interval to the machines. 

Login information should be printed out with the help of a script, so default user "vagrant" can see when each user has logged (first login, last login, time between the last two logins and average time between all logins).
